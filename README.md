It intercepts tile data requests from apps like News, Weather, and Finance, then feeds them updated info from sources like ESPN or BBC News.  
It’s a preservation + revival project for anyone who misses Live Tiles.

## Why "OpenMetro"?

"Metro" refers to the bold, typography-focused design language used in Windows 8.x.

"Open" reflects the spirit of open-source — anyone can view, use, and contribute to the project.

| **Windows Store**    | 🟠 Maybe          | Low priority – requires extensive reverse engineering |
I'll come back to this.
